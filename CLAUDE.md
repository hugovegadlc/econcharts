# econcharts — CLAUDE.md

## Purpose
Automated production of publication-quality economic charts from a minimal, substance-only spec. Form (style, color, layout) is pre-encoded; the user supplies only content, data, per-series chart type, and domain annotations. A narrow DSL for macro time-series charts — deliberately **not** a general grammar of graphics.

## Core principles
- **Spec, not code.** Charts are declared in YAML, validated and resolved by deterministic Python, rendered by a fixed engine. No code generation, no AI in the render path.
- **Substance over form.** The spec carries content + domain semantics only. Every formal choice lives in the theme. Overrides are *selections* from theme-named sets (`color: orange`, `line: dashed`), never raw values; the chart-level `style:` block is the sole raw-value escape hatch.
- **Narrowness is the feature.** Resist adding knobs — each new option is drift toward ggplot.
- **Domain-semantic vocabulary.** Users write in an economist's terms, not graphics primitives. The registry that resolves tokens like `recessions: peru` / `target: inflation_pe` is the planned differentiator (backlog — not yet implemented).
- **Hand-authorable first.** The full pipeline works on hand-written specs; an AI authoring layer is a separate, optional, last-built extension.

## Documents — who owns what
- **GRAMMAR.md** — the **canonical, frozen spec grammar**: every key, vocabulary, and shorthand, including the batch document. When the spec surface changes, GRAMMAR.md is updated in the same change. **Do not duplicate its contents here.**
- **manual.html** — the user manual shipped in the bundle (self-contained HTML).
- **README.md** — public-facing overview + dev quickstart.
- This file — design rationale, architecture, conventions, status.

## Status (v0.1.0 — feature-complete core)
Done: line/bar/area/stacked (+ combinations, secondary axis), per-series marks with deterministic label placement, hline/vline/span/band annotations, adaptive daily→yearly date axis, authoritative `period` framing with `start`/`end` tokens, Excel + inline data, bbva theme, named export sizes, batch documents → figures + PPTX deck, CLI, frozen Windows exe (ship/), 182 tests incl. golden images.

Backlog (build in this order when asked): domain registry (`recessions:`/`target:`/event marks — `registry/` dir exists but is empty; tokens are YAML data, not code), polished svg/pdf backends (`svg.fonttype: "none"` for LaTeX), gsheet/db resolvers (db hits tsdb-api at `db.simgol.net`), `fan` chart type (PyBEAR forecast bands), facets, slim bundle (drop scipy), AI authoring layer **last**.

## Pipeline
`YAML spec → pydantic validate (spec.py) → resolve data + frame (data.py, render._resolve_framed) → matplotlib render → png | svg | pdf` — and at the batch level: `batch.yaml → per-chart jobs (fail-soft) → figures + .pptx deck`.

`bbva source/` holds the original add-in (`*.xlam`) — **never commit it** (gitignored).

## The spec
The full grammar lives in **GRAMMAR.md** — consult it before writing or validating any spec. Essentials: `type` is required per series and is also the combination rule (bars dodge, stacked stack ±, areas fill+stack, lines overlay on top); `mark` is a **per-series field** (`mark: last`, `mark: {at, marker, value, text}`), *not* an annotation; annotations today are exactly `hline` / `vline` / `span` / `band`. Canonical combo (stacked contributions + total line):
```yaml
title: PBI real — contribuciones al crecimiento
subtitle: var. % anual, puntos porcentuales
source: BCRP            # metadata only — not drawn (lives beside the chart)
period: 2018Q1:end
series:
  - {name: Consumo,     data: "excel:pbi.xlsx#trim!c_consumo",   type: stacked}
  - {name: Inversión,   data: "excel:pbi.xlsx#trim!c_inversion", type: stacked}
  - {name: Sector ext., data: "excel:pbi.xlsx#trim!c_xn",        type: stacked}
  - {name: PBI,         data: "excel:pbi.xlsx#trim!pbi_yoy",     type: line, mark: last}
annotations:
  - hline: 0
```

## Data resolution
Ref grammar dispatched by prefix: `excel:<file>#<sheet>!<column>` (implemented); `gsheet:`/`db:` recognized, not implemented. Inline data: a list (aligns positionally to the `period` window) or a `{period: value}` map. The resolver contract is fixed: **always** a tidy/long DataFrame `[period, series, value]`, normalized wide→long once at the boundary. Workbook paths resolve against `data_root` (env `ECONCHARTS_DATA_ROOT`; the CLI sets it to the spec/batch file's directory). Excel period column defaults to the sheet's first column; freq is inferred (string tokens, bare years, or datetimes via median spacing).

## Time & framing
- Internal index = pandas Periods with explicit freq (D/Q/M/Y), one freq per chart.
- `period` is the **authoritative axis frame**: the chart spans exactly that window (xlim + ticks) even where a series has no data; data outside is clipped; no `period` → the data's own range. Either bound may be the data-driven token `start`/`end` (sample min/max across all dated series — ≠ any one series' own first/last, which is what `mark: last` means). `end` forces the two-phase resolve in `render._resolve_framed`.
- **Every date→axis-x conversion goes through `render._periods_to_x` and friends** — periods map to their *midpoint*; bars/vlines use period *boundaries* (see `AxisCoords`). Never mix strings / Timestamps / mpl-dates downstream.
- `timeaxis.plan_ticks` picks the display granularity adaptively (finest that fits the width; thin every-other before coarsening) — daily data over a decade labels in years.
- es-PE formatting (month abbrevs, `,` decimal / `.` thousands) lives in `theme.py` — never in the spec.

## Theme
- A theme = one `themes/<name>.yaml` (single source of truth): named `colors` table, series `cycle`, `annotations` vocabulary, `date_labels` patterns, matplotlib `rc` params. `theme.py` is the generic engine — it resolves color NAMES→hex everywhere and applies rc in memory (no `.mplstyle` on disk).
- **Never hard-code a color in renderers** — pull from the active theme. (Known violations to clean up: subtitle/leader colors in `render.py`, contrast pair in `theme.label_contrast_color`.)
- `bbva` is the reference theme; primary `#001391`, extracted from the official `Addin_BBVA_2025.xlam` (May 2025, "Version 3").
- **Named output sizes** (the add-in's export presets, physical mm): `word_half` 75×60, `word_full` 117×60, `slides_half` 85×70 (**default — use this when showing examples**), `slides_full` 140×75. Size and backend are render-time choices (one spec → many targets), not spec fields.

## Marks & label placement
matplotlib's weak spot is label collision; econcharts handles it **deterministically** (no adjustText — it was dropped):
- Per-type placement in `marks.py`: line → dot + label on the outer side of the curve; bar → above (below if negative); area → above the curve; stacked → centered in the segment with auto white/navy contrast.
- Cross-series rules in `draw_line_marks`: at a shared x the lowest goes below, rest above; 3+ series at the last point go right of the endpoint.
- `render._finalize_marks` post-processes after layout: hides stacked labels that don't fit their segment, offsets line labels perpendicular to the local slope (constant visual gap), spreads cramped right-labels with leader lines, then grows axis limits (capped) so nothing clips.
- Marks carry `gid = marks.MARK_GID` and `set_in_layout(False)` so constrained layout ignores them.

## Renderer & output
- One `render(spec, size) -> Figure`; `save(fig, out, backend)` infers the backend from the suffix. **No `bbox_inches="tight"`** — the figure must save at its exact named physical size; constrained layout fits content *within* the fixed figsize instead.
- `png` (Google Slides): dpi=300, transparent. `svg`/`pdf` are registered but unpolished (svg still needs `svg.fonttype: "none"` for LaTeX text matching).
- Annotation mapping: `span`→`axvspan`, `band`→`axhspan` (label auto-placed in the widest clear stretch), `vline`→`axvline`, `hline`→`axhline`.
- Layering: fills behind bars behind lines (`Z_AREA < Z_BAR < Z_LINE`), annotation fills below / vlines above series, labels on top.

## Batch & deck & CLI
- A batch = orchestration header (`data_root`, `output_dir`, `render` subset) + inheritable defaults (`theme`, `size`, `backend`, `date_label`: header → chart override) + `charts` keyed by `id`. Header validated up front; chart bodies validated lazily so one bad chart can't sink the batch (**fail-soft** — `run_jobs` records per-chart errors and continues). Paths resolve relative to the batch file. Outputs `<id>_<yyyymmdd>.<backend>`.
- `econcharts build batch.yaml [--only ids] [-o DIR] [--force]` renders all + assembles a PPTX deck (2 charts per slide at true physical size via `deck.py`); asks once before overwriting. `econcharts render spec.yaml -o out.png [--size] [--backend]` is the single-chart shortcut. Non-zero exit if anything failed.

## Ship (frozen exe)
`ship/econcharts.spec` is the checked-in PyInstaller manifest (bundles `themes/`, pptx templates; excludes GUI toolkits); `ship/build.py` freezes, lays user-facing files (examples, manual.html, run.bat) at the bundle root, and zips to `~/econcharts_ship.zip`. Build from the project `.venv` (clean python.org Python — not Anaconda).

## Conventions
- Python ≥3.11 (dev env: project `.venv`, Python 3.14, mpl 3.11 — install with `pip install -e ".[dev]"`); pydantic v2; matplotlib only for rendering; Agg backend in tests.
- **Errors surface at the right boundary naming the offending key — never a raw matplotlib/pandas traceback.** Spec problems → `SpecError`; data → `DataError`; theme → `ThemeError`; render → `RenderError`; batch header → `BatchError`.
- One responsibility per module, per the layout above. `timeaxis` stays pure (no drawing).
- themes/ and registry/ are data OUTSIDE the package, resolved relative to `econcharts/` — works for editable installs and the frozen exe (`--add-data`); a plain wheel would not see them, and wheels are a non-goal.
- No browser/interactive output; no AI in the render path.

## Testing
- `pytest` from the project `.venv` (182 tests, ~16s). Golden images per chart type in `tests/baseline/` via `pytest-mpl` (`pytest --mpl`). Schema tests assert malformed specs fail at the right key.
- `conftest.py` at the repo root sets Agg + points `ECONCHARTS_DATA_ROOT` at `examples/`.

## Dependencies
Core: `matplotlib, pandas, numpy, scipy` (PCHIP smoothing only), `pydantic>=2, pyyaml, openpyxl, python-pptx`. (`adjustText` is listed in pyproject but unused — placement is deterministic; drop it when touching deps.) Later resolvers: `gspread, google-api-python-client, requests`.

## Non-goals
- Not a general grammar of graphics (not ggplot / Vega). Not interactive / web.
- No per-chart styling beyond theme-named selections + the `style:` escape hatch.
- No AI in the render path. No wheel distribution (the ship is a frozen exe).
